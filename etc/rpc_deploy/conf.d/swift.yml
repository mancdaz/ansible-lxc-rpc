# Setup swift group variables when using swift (Not required if not using swift)
# part power is required under swift. This can't be changed once the ring is built
# For account/container speciying min_part_hours and repl_number is all that can be set.
# These 2 can be set at the "swift" level to work as a default.
# Alternatively defaults will be used (repl_number of 3, and min_part_hours of 1).
# For storage policies, a name and unique index is required as well as repl_number and
# min_part_hours which will be set to a default value if not specified.
# There MUST be a storage policy with index 0 configured which will be the default for legacy containers (created pre-storage policies).
# You can set one policy to be "default: yes" this will be the default storage policy for non-legacy containers that are created.
# The index value must be unique.
# Storage policies can be set to "deprecated: yes" which will mean they are not used
# You can specify default drives in the global_overrides section, these drives will be used
# if no other drives are specified per device. These work in the same way as the per node
# drives, so the same settings can be used.

# global_overrides:
#   swift:
#     part_power: 8
#     account:
#       repl_number: 3
#       min_part_hours: 1
#     container:
#       repl_number: 3
#     storage_policies:
#      - policy:
#          name: gold
#          index: 0
#          repl_number: 3
#          default: yes
#      - policy:
#          name: silver
#          index: 1

# User defined Swift Proxy hosts - not required when not using swift
# Will deploy a swift-proxy container on these hosts.
# Recommend mirroring the infra_hosts
# swift-proxy_hosts:
#   infra1:
#     ip: 172.29.236.100
#   infra2:
#     ip: 172.29.236.101
#   infra3:
#     ip: 172.29.236.102

# User defined Object Storage Hosts - this is not a required group
# Under swift_vars you can specify the host specific swift_vars.
# region - the swift region, this isn't required.
# zone - the swift zone, this isn't required either, will default to 0
# mount_point - where the drives are mounted on the server
# drives - A list of drives in the server (Must have a name as a minimum)
# Above 4 vars are "host specific"
# weight: a disks weight (defaults to 100 if not specified)
# repl_ip: IP specific for object replication (not required)
# repl_port: Port specific for object replication (not required)
# groups: A list of groups to add the drive to. A group is either a storage policy or the account or container servers. (If not specified defaults to all groups, so container/account/all storage policies).
# The above 4 can be specified on a per host or per drive basis
# Or both, in which case "per drive" will take precedence for the specific drive.
# ip can be specified in swift_vars to override the hosts ip
# or per drive to override all for that specific drive.
# swift_hosts:
